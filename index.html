            <h3><b>AKA Castle World (Winterfell Castle)</b></h3>
            <p class="preview">One of the main filming locations for the series is the 1,000-acre (400-hectare) grounds around Castle Ward in Northern Ireland. Located near the village of Strangford in County Down, the main castle is a National Trust property dating from the 18th century. The property, however, has been in the Ward family since 1570; Old Castle Ward was most likely built by Nicholas Ward around 1590. The farmyard of the Old Castle serves as the location of Winterfell, home of the ill-fated Starks and the backdrop for most of Season 1. You can even sign up for a “Winterfell Tour” that takes you on a journey of 20 key filming locations throughout the castle complex.</p>

            <p class="preview">Dark Hedges in Northern Ireland, an avenue of beech trees planted by the Stuart Family in the eighteenth century as an entrance to their mansion. As one of the most-photographed natural phenomena in Northern Ireland, some viewers likely recognized the tunnel of trees when it was used as a northern part of the King’s Road. In the first episode of Season 2 when Arya Stark has escaped Winterfell disguised as a boy, she travels up this road in a cart with a group of boys and men headed north toward The Wall to join the Night’s Watch.</p>

            <p class="preview">Downhill is a beach at Northern Ireland that stretches for approximately 7 miles (11 kilometers); designated as an Area of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation, the scenic beach draws visitors from all over to County Londonderry and the small nearby town of Castlerock. In the Game of Thrones universe, the beach is visited by Stannis Baratheon and Melisandre where they burn the Seven Idols of Westeros and the Red Priestess first proclaims her oft-repeated catchphrase.</p>
