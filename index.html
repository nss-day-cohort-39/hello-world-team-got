            <h3><b>AKA Castle World (Winterfell Castle)</b></h3>
            <p class="preview">One of the main filming locations for the series is the 1,000-acre (400-hectare) grounds around Castle Ward in Northern Ireland. Located near the village of Strangford in County Down, the main castle is a National Trust property dating from the 18th century. The property, however, has been in the Ward family since 1570; Old Castle Ward was most likely built by Nicholas Ward around 1590. The farmyard of the Old Castle serves as the location of Winterfell, home of the ill-fated Starks and the backdrop for most of Season 1. You can even sign up for a “Winterfell Tour” that takes you on a journey of 20 key filming locations throughout the castle complex.</p>

            <p class="preview">Dark Hedges in Northern Ireland, an avenue of beech trees planted by the Stuart Family in the eighteenth century as an entrance to their mansion. As one of the most-photographed natural phenomena in Northern Ireland, some viewers likely recognized the tunnel of trees when it was used as a northern part of the King’s Road. In the first episode of Season 2 when Arya Stark has escaped Winterfell disguised as a boy, she travels up this road in a cart with a group of boys and men headed north toward The Wall to join the Night’s Watch.</p>

In the Game of Thrones universe, the beach is visited by Stannis Baratheon and Melisandre where they burn the Seven Idols of Westeros and the Red Priestess first proclaims her oft-repeated catchphrase.</p>
